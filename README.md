# MODULE 4 CHALLENGE - Pandas DataFrame

## Description

### PyCitySchools
As the "Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district", I used Pandas DataFrame to analyze school and standardized test data. This information will be used to help the school board and the mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. 


## PyCitySchools Report

This project used Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze the cityâ€™s school district. The school district compromised of two types of schools: Charter and District School. A district wide examination of the standardized test result was conducted along with other assessments.

Based on the assessments, two key observations were noticed:
* The  Top 5 Performing schools where Charter schools while the 5 Bottom performing schools where District schools. Charter schools appear to be outperforming their District counterparts.
* The higher the Budget per Student does not have any relation with student performance. It appears that with limited budgeting the students/school performs better.
